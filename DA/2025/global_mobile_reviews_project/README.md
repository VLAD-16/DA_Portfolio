## 🚀 Key Stages
1. **Data Cleaning** — handling missing values, unifying currencies, brands, and countries.
2. **EDA in Python** — visualization of distributions, sentiment analysis, price–rating correlation.
3. **SQL Analytics** — aggregates for the dashboard: rating, sentiment, verified purchases.
4. **Tableau Dashboard** — interactive visualizations:
    - 🌍 Sentiment by Country
    - 📱 Price vs Rating by Brand
    - 💬 Verified vs Non-Verified Comparison
    - 📈 Sentiment Trend over Time

## 📈 Main Insights
- **Apple** has the highest average rating, but **Xiaomi / Realme** offer the best price-to-quality ratio.
- **User sentiment** is more positive in countries with lower average prices.
- **Verified reviews** have an average sentiment that is 8–12% higher.
